 * A class to model a generic phone book.  
 * A generic phone book can keep different kinds of contact details. 
 * A generic phone book supports two kinds of record retrieval:
 * - search by name
 * - search by phone number
 * 
 * Records kept within a PhoneBook object are sorted according
 * 	to their natural order. 
 * 
 * Each record is associated with a key. The key is a field in the record.
 * Each key is associated with exactly one record. 
 * Hence, if a new record "happens" to have the same key 
 * 	as an existing record in the list, the new record will 
 * 	NOT be added to the list.
